# The 100 Project Challenge
A repository containing dozens of projects requiring vastly different skillsets. All the projects that I might add to this repository can be found from the image below.

I won't be making all of the projects in the picture but I'll be making as many as I can. I will be doing these projects in different languages such as rust, python, js etc.

I will not be doing the projects in order but instead randomly as I see fit. Each project will contain a README.md that shows my thought process when I was making it and instructions on how to run the project on your own machine.

## The goal
My goal with this is obviously to learn new skills and maybe even for new employers to see what I'm made off and if I'm a right fit for their company.

## Navigation
Each project will be in a sepperate directory that starts with the project number that matches the one in the photo followed by the project name that can also be found in the photo.

## Contributing And Feedback
You are fully welcome to leave feedback on any of the projects and suggest any improvements I can make to them. I'm always open to new suggestions and ideas that can improve my projects.
