# Thought process
So my thought process for this project was pretty simple as the project was too. First up as a lazy programmer I thought to just use a library to do all the work for me lol.
So I googled one and implemented it according to the documentation, but I thought this was a little too easy so I also did a manual method which basically randomly picks the
adjectives and nouns from files and outputs it.
