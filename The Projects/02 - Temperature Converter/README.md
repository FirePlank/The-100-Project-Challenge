# Thought Process
So this project was really more annoying than challenging above all else due to having to take a lot of
inputs from the user and taking input in Rust can be quite tedious, but I guess that's what i get for
trying to make things more challenging by using Rust.

The actual project was simple enough with me just having to google all the correct formulas to convert
between the different temperature types. I implemented support for celsius, fahrenheit and kelvin as
those are the most popular ways of representing temperature.

I also made a little more effort to clean the code and actually fix the warnings Rust gave me.
