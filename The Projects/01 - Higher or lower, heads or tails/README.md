# Thought process
So this was an another fairly easy one. I wasen't sure if by higher/lower it meant the hilo game
where you choose if a number shown is below or above an another hidden number or the classical guess the number and it will tell you
if the number you guessed is lower or higher so I just decided to go with the ladder. The coinflip was pretty simple as well, just generate
a random number between 1 and 2 and if it lands on 1 interpret it as it being heads and if its 2 to interpret it being as tails.
